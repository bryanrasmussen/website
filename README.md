##Things to note

This is a version of [Balupton's website in docpad](http://balupton.com), the layout and styling has been changed to be compatible with bootstrap. 

Sorting of blog posts is done by sorting on the timestamp that has to be found in the the markdown file. 

There can be left over cruft here that needs to be removed, just making a quick repo right now.
