This site is a statically generated site using  [docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad "Top Level Docpad link").
The technologies used in this docpad site are: Node.js for the server, stylus for css preprocessing, markdown for content authoring, coffeescript for scripts and coffeekup for the templates (although at some point I will move it to JavaScript and EJS respectively as that is what I like)
